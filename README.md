# Algorithms_for_Sequnce_Analysis

This file contains the codes and various contents pertaining to the Algorithms for Sequence Analysis Course
offered by Center for BioInformatics of Saarland University. 

##Structure of the Repo

The repo is structured mainly into two folders, namely "algo_implementation" and "assignments". 

##algo_implementation

This folder contains codes for practise implementing various algorithms taught in the class. The codes 
are well commented for clear understanding

##assignments

This folder contains the weekly assignment PDFs and thier respetive solutions. Contetns of each assignment is kept inside
its respetive sub_folder which will contain the PDF describing the tasks, the PDF containing the solutions to the 
theoretical questions and a python file which will contain the solution of the coding ecercise.
